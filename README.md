# Cantara-Songlib
![GitHub branch check runs](https://img.shields.io/github/check-runs/CantaraProject/cantara-songlib/master)

A reimplementation of the Cantara Backend in Rust.

This crate provides functionality for parsing songs in different formats (lyrics, scores and different languages) and export them as a song presentation or music sheet.
It is part of the effort to rewrite [Cantara](https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara) in Rust.

> [!NOTE]
> While this crate is already usable, some functions are yet to be implemented. Please expect breaking changes.
