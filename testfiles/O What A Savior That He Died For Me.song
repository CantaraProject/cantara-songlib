Oh, what a Saviour that He died for me!
From condemnation He hath made me free;
"He that believeth on the Son," said He,
"Hath everlasting life."

"Verily, verily, I say unto you;
Verily, verily," message ever new!
"He that believeth on the Son," 'tis true!
"Hath everlasting life!"

All my iniquities on Him were laid,
All my indebtedness by Him was paid;
All who believe on Him, the Lord hath said,
"Hath everlasting life."

"Verily, verily, I say unto you;
Verily, verily," message ever new!
"He that believeth on the Son," 'tis true!
"Hath everlasting life!"

Though poor and needy, I can trust my Lord;
Though weak and sinful, I believe His Word;
O glad message! Ev'ry child of God
"Hath everlasting life."

"Verily, verily, I say unto you;
Verily, verily," message ever new!
"He that believeth on the Son," 'tis true!
"Hath everlasting life!"

Though all unworthy, yet I will not doubt;
For him that cometh He will not cast out;
"He that believeth," oh, the good news shout!
"Hath everlasting life."

"Verily, verily, I say unto you;
Verily, verily," message ever new!
"He that believeth on the Son," 'tis true!
"Hath everlasting life!"
